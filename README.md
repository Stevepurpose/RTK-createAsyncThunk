# Redux Toolkit createAsyncThunk
A project which I used to manage server state using the Redux toolkit createAsyncThunk,it's a project
designed basically to show my understanding of createAsyncThunk.I used json-server as database.I only performed
two requests: 'POST' and 'GET' requests.It serves as teh evolution root to my use of RTK Query where I performed most requests.
